A student performance website serves as a platform designed to help track, monitor, and assess the academic progress, attendance and achievements of students. The primary goal is to provide a centralized and easily accessible space for students, teachers, and parents to stay informed about academic performance.
Each student will be assigned login credentials in the form of their roll numbers. Consequently, parents will also have the ability to access their child's performance using these credentials.
The key distinction in this project lies in the fact that performance analysis will be presented in the form of graphs, making visualization both easy and comprehensible.
